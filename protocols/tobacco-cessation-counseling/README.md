# Tobacco Cessation Counseling

## Target Population
Designed for patients with diabetes who are smokers based on their most recent tobacco use screening.
## Recommendations
The protocol recommends that clinicians provide smoking cessation counseling to these patients at least every 6 months. This aligns with the understanding that smoking cessation is a crucial aspect of managing diabetes and improving patient outcomes.
## Importance
Smoking exacerbates the complications associated with diabetes, including cardiovascular issues and poor wound healing. By integrating regular smoking cessation counseling into diabetes care, the protocol aims to enhance patient health, reduce smoking-related risks, and ultimately improve diabetes management.
## Conclusion
The protocol identifies patients who smoke and have active diabetes, ensuring they receive timely counseling on smoking cessation. If the patient has not received counseling within the last 6 months, the protocol will trigger a recommendation for the clinician to initiate this intervention.
