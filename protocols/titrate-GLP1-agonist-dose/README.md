# GLP-1 Dose Titration

## Target Population
Designed for patients who are currently prescribed GLP-1 medications, which include Dulaglutide, Liraglutide, Semaglutide, Canagliflozin, and Tirzepatide. It specifically targets patients undergoing weight management with these medications.
## Recommendations
The protocol provides guidelines for adjusting GLP-1 dosages based on recent weight loss trends:

- Increase Dose: If weight loss is less than 5% per month.
- Decrease or Stop Dose: If weight loss exceeds 5% per week.
- Maintain Current Dose: For weight loss rates between 5% per week and 5% per month.
## Importance
This protocol is crucial for optimizing the effectiveness of GLP-1 medications. By aligning dosage adjustments with actual weight loss results, it helps enhance patient outcomes and manage potential side effects more effectively. It ensures that patients receive appropriate treatment adjustments based on their progress, improving overall treatment efficacy.
## Conclusion
The GLP-1 dose titration protocol helps streamline clinical decision-making by automating dosage adjustments based on weight loss metrics. For clinicians, it reduces the burden of manual monitoring and decision-making, ensuring timely and appropriate changes to medication dosages. This can lead to improved patient outcomes and more efficient use of GLP-1 therapies.
