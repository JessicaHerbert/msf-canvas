# Hypertension Diagnosis Protocol

## Target Population
The Hypertension Diagnosis Protocol targets all patients who have been diagnosed with hypertension. It is designed to identify individuals with this condition within the patient population, regardless of other criteria.

## Recommendations
The protocol generates specific actions based on the patient's diagnosis of hypertension:

 - For patients diagnosed with hypertension: The protocol prompts the clinician to contact the patient and provides a narrative detailing the diagnosis date. This ensures that appropriate follow-up care is scheduled.
 - For patients not diagnosed with hypertension: It confirms that no action is needed regarding hypertension and marks the protocol as satisfied.
## Importance
The protocol is important for ensuring that patients with a diagnosis of hypertension are actively monitored and followed up with. By providing automated reminders and recommendations for patient communication, it helps maintain continuity of care and ensures that necessary interventions or follow-ups are not overlooked.

## Conclusion
The Hypertension Diagnosis Protocol automates the process of managing patients with hypertension by identifying those who have been diagnosed and recommending follow-up actions. It streamlines clinician workflow by integrating automated reminders and communication recommendations directly into the clinical process, enhancing the management of hypertension and improving patient care efficiency.
