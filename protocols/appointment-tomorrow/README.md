# Appointment Tomorrow

### Target Population
This protocol is designed for managing patient follow-up related to upcoming appointments. It is suitable for patients who have scheduled appointments in the near future, specifically those with appointments the next day.
### Recommendations
The protocol checks whether a patient has an appointment scheduled for tomorrow and ensures that appropriate follow-up has been conducted. It verifies if the patient has been reached by phone or if there have been at least two phone call attempts.
### Importance
The protocol helps streamline appointment management by ensuring patients are contacted in advance if they have an upcoming appointment. This is crucial for reducing no-show rates and improving patient engagement. It ensures that any gaps in communication are identified and addressed, enhancing overall patient care and operational efficiency.
### Conclusion
By integrating this protocol, clinicians can better manage patient follow-up tasks. The system will automatically assess if patients with appointments tomorrow have been contacted or if additional attempts are needed. This reduces manual tracking and improves the likelihood of patients attending their scheduled appointments, thereby optimizing workflow and patient satisfaction.
