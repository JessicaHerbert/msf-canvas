# Screen for GLP-1 Agonist Side Effects

### Target Population
This protocol is designed for patients who have recently started a GLP-1 receptor agonist medication, or have had a dose adjustment, particularly at least one week ago. GLP-1 medications are often prescribed for managing type 2 diabetes and obesity.
### Recommendations
The protocol recommends that clinicians administer a side effects questionnaire to monitor for common adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal bloating, associated with GLP-1 medications. If the questionnaire has not been completed since the patient started or adjusted their GLP-1 medication, the protocol will flag this as a due task and recommend completing the questionnaire.
### Importance
Regular monitoring of side effects for patients on GLP-1 medications is crucial because these medications can cause significant gastrointestinal issues, which can impact patient adherence and overall treatment effectiveness. By implementing this protocol, clinicians can ensure timely identification and management of these side effects, potentially improving patient outcomes.
### Conclusion
The GLP-1 Side Effects Screening Protocol helps clinicians efficiently track and manage side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 medications. By integrating this screening into the workflow, it ensures that potential issues are addressed promptly, enhancing patient care and supporting better treatment adherence.
