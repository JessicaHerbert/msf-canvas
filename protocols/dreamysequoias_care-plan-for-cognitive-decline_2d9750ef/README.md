# Summary of Protocol for Generating Care Plans for Cognitive Decline Risk

The protocol aims to create personalized care plans for patients with modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline, enhancing their brain health through targeted interventions.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients who have undergone cognitive assessments and have recorded responses in their medical notes. From this group, a subset of patients with modifiable risk factors is considered. These risk factors are identified through structured assessments and questionnaires, focusing on lifestyle factors, medical history, and other health indicators. Patients with non-modifiable risk factors or those already enrolled in conflicting care plans are excluded.

The protocol outlines several key actions:

1. **Administrative Action:** A user interface feature, specifically a button, is to be implemented in the electronic health record (EHR) system. This button, located at the patient level in the top menu, facilitates the processing of patient data.

2. **Data Processing:** When the button is clicked, the system processes the "Structured Assessment" and "Questionnaire" responses from the patient's notes. Specific assessments are defined in the code to extract relevant data.

3. **Document Generation:** A new external document in rich text format (RTF) is generated, presented in an editable format. This document includes patient details such as name, sex, age, MRN (Medical Record Number), and contact information.

4. **Care Plan Development:** 
   - **Section 1:** Extracts and displays responses from three structured assessments, with placeholders in the code for these responses.
   - **Section 2:** Utilizes the assessment data to make an API call to the "Claude-3.5-sonnet" model. This generates three activities aimed at improving brain health and suggests three lifestyle modifications tailored to the patient's needs. A placeholder for the next appointment date is also included.

5. **Review and Approval:** The generated care plan must be reviewed by a healthcare professional to ensure its accuracy and relevance before it is finalized and implemented in the patient's care regimen.

Important information to note includes:
- The protocol targets patients with modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline.
- Exclusion criteria ensure that only suitable patients are included, avoiding conflicts with other care plans or studies.
- The protocol emphasizes the integration of technology, such as EHR systems and API calls, to streamline data processing and care plan development.
- The involvement of healthcare professionals in reviewing the care plan ensures that it meets clinical standards and is tailored to the patient's needs.
