# Summary of the CDC's Return-to-Play Protocol for Concussion in Sports

The goal of the CDC's Return-to-Play Protocol is to provide a safe and structured process for athletes recovering from a concussion to return to sports activities. This protocol aims to minimize the risk of further injury by ensuring that individuals are symptom-free and medically cleared before resuming play.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all individuals who have participated in sports and have been diagnosed with a concussion by a qualified healthcare professional. From this group, a subset is considered for the protocol, specifically those aged 5 years and older, who have been symptom-free for at least 24 hours, and have received medical clearance to start the return-to-play process.

The protocol outlines a stepwise progression for returning to play, starting with an initial rest period to allow acute symptoms to resolve. This involves avoiding activities that could exacerbate symptoms, such as screen time, reading, and physical exertion. Once symptoms have resolved, the individual can begin the stepwise return-to-play progression:

1. **Light Aerobic Exercise:** Engage in light activities like walking or stationary cycling at a slow to medium pace, without resistance training. Monitor for any recurrence of symptoms.

2. **Moderate Activity:** Increase intensity with activities such as running or skating drills, avoiding head impact activities. Continue to monitor for symptom recurrence.

3. **Non-Contact Training Drills:** Participate in more complex training drills, such as passing drills in football or hockey, and start progressive resistance training. Monitor for symptom recurrence.

4. **Full Contact Practice:** After receiving medical clearance, participate in normal training activities. Monitor for symptom recurrence.

5. **Return to Play:** Resume normal game play and competition.

Throughout the process, continuous monitoring and documentation are crucial. If symptoms recur at any step, the individual should return to the previous step and attempt progression again after being symptom-free for at least 24 hours. Each step of the progression, including any symptoms experienced and the duration of each step, should be documented.

Final medical clearance from a healthcare provider is required before the individual can return to full play.

Important points to note include:

- **Exclusion Criteria:** Individuals will be excluded from the protocol if they exhibit new or worsening symptoms during the process, have a history of multiple concussions or prolonged recovery, or are unable to follow the stepwise progression due to cognitive or physical limitations.

- **Monitoring and Documentation:** Continuous monitoring for symptom recurrence is essential, and detailed documentation of each step is required to ensure safety and track progress.

- **Medical Clearance:** Final medical clearance is mandatory before returning to full play, ensuring that the individual is fully recovered and ready to resume sports activities.

This protocol is designed to ensure a safe return to sports following a concussion, reducing the risk of further injury and promoting long-term health and well-being for athletes.
