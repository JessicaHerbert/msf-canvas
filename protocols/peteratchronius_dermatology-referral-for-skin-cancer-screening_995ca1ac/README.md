# Autonomous Dermatology Referral Protocol for High-Risk Adults

The protocol aims to streamline the process of referring adults at increased risk for skin cancer to dermatology services for preventive screening, without requiring a provider visit unless necessary.

## Protocol Flow

The protocol empowers trained medical assistants (MAs) and registered nurses (RNs) to autonomously initiate dermatology referrals based on standing orders. It targets adults aged 20 and older who have not had a dermatology visit or skin cancer screening within specified intervals and possess high-risk traits. The process ensures that eligible patients are identified and referred efficiently, while those with new dermatologic concerns are directed to appropriate diagnostic evaluation.

## Key Information

- **Target Population**: 
  - Adults aged 20â€“39 with no dermatology visit or skin cancer screening in the past 3 years.
  - Adults aged 40 and older with no dermatology visit or skin cancer screening in the past 12 months.
  - Must have one or more high-risk traits such as fair skin, more than 50 moles, family history of melanoma, personal history of skin cancer, frequent sun exposure, or history of blistering sunburns.

- **Exclusions**:
  - Patients currently presenting with a new or changing skin lesion or rash.
  - Patients who have had a skin cancer screening within the applicable timeframe.
  - Patients without any of the specified risk factors.

- **Actions for Qualified Patients**:
  - During visit prep or intake, check if the patient meets age and risk criteria.
  - If qualified, flag the patient for screening and inform them of their eligibility.
  - Confirm the absence of new lesions or rashes.
  - If the patient agrees, place a dermatology referral for screening, specifying the qualifying risk factor.
  - Provide instructions not to wear makeup or skin products to the appointment.
  - Offer and document a Release of Information (ROI) form if prior screenings were done elsewhere.

- **If Patient Declines**:
  - Document the reason for refusal.
  - Add a note stating the patient met criteria but declined, and that education was provided.

- **Protocol Limitations**:
  - Do not trigger the protocol if a new skin concern is documented.
  - Ensure documentation of the encounter and follow-up per standard clinic process.

This protocol ensures that high-risk patients receive timely skin cancer screenings, optimizing preventive care and resource allocation within the healthcare system.
