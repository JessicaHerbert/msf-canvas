# Care Plan for Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)

The goal of this protocol is to provide a structured care plan for individuals diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), focusing on cognitive stimulation interventions to enhance cognitive function and quality of life.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes individuals aged 55 and older diagnosed with MCI according to DSM-5 criteria, residing in community or assisted living settings. A subset of this population is further considered if they have been assessed using standardized cognitive tools like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and have shown interest in cognitive stimulation interventions.

The protocol outlines exclusion criteria to ensure the suitability of participants. Individuals with dementia, Alzheimer's disease, severe psychiatric disorders, significant sensory impairments, or those involved in other cognitive intervention studies are excluded.

Key actions required to satisfy the protocol include conducting comprehensive cognitive assessments to confirm MCI diagnosis, developing personalized care plans with tailored cognitive stimulation interventions, and implementing activities such as memory exercises and social engagement at least twice a week. Monitoring and documenting progress monthly, adjusting care plans based on feedback, and providing education and support to caregivers are also essential components. Regular follow-up appointments with healthcare providers are recommended to assess overall health and cognitive status.
