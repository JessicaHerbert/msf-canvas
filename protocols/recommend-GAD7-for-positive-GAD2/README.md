### Target Population
Patients who have undergone a GAD-2 (General Anxiety Disorder-2) screening. Specifically, it targets individuals whose most recent GAD-2 score is greater than 2, indicating potential anxiety symptoms that warrant further evaluation.

### Recommendations
When the protocol identifies a GAD-2 score above 2 and no GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-9) has been administered recently, it recommends that the clinician administer the GAD-7 questionnaire. This recommendation is based on the need to conduct a more comprehensive assessment of anxiety symptoms.

### Importance
The GAD-7 is a more detailed tool for assessing anxiety compared to the GAD-2. This ensures that patients who show initial signs of potential anxiet (indicated by a GAD-2 score above 2) receive a thorough evaluation. By automating the recommendation for a GAD-7, the protocol helps improve diagnostic accuracy and ensures that patients who need further assessment are not overlooked.

### Conclusion
This protocol automates the decision-making process for further anxiety screening based on GAD-2 results. It enhances clinician workflow by providing timely recommendations for additional assessment when needed. By integrating this into your system, you can streamline the process of identifying and addressing potential ansiety, improving patient care and supporting clinicians in making informed decisions.
