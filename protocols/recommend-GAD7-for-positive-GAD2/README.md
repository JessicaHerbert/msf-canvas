### Target Population
Patients who have undergone a PHQ-2 (Patient Health Questionnaire-2) screening. Specifically, it targets individuals whose most recent PHQ-2 score is greater than 2, indicating potential depression symptoms that warrant further evaluation.

### Recommendations
When the protocol identifies a PHQ-2 score above 2 and no PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) has been administered recently, it recommends that the clinician administer the PHQ-9 questionnaire. This recommendation is based on the need to conduct a more comprehensive assessment of depression symptoms.

### Importance
The PHQ-9 is a more detailed tool for assessing depression severity compared to the PHQ-2. This ensures that patients who show initial signs of potential depression (indicated by a PHQ-2 score above 2) receive a thorough evaluation. By automating the recommendation for a PHQ-9, the protocol helps improve diagnostic accuracy and ensures that patients who need further assessment are not overlooked.

### Conclusion
This protocol automates the decision-making process for further depression screening based on PHQ-2 results. It enhances clinician workflow by providing timely recommendations for additional assessment when needed. By integrating this into your system, you can streamline the process of identifying and addressing potential depression, improving patient care and supporting clinicians in making informed decisions.
