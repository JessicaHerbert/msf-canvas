# Summary: EMR Creation Protocol for Wound Care Documentation

This protocol aims to establish a standardized process for creating and maintaining Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) for patients requiring wound care, ensuring comprehensive documentation and continuity of care.

The protocol targets patients presenting with acute or chronic wounds that require ongoing care and documentation. It excludes patients with minor wounds not needing follow-up, those refusing EMR creation, and individuals unable to provide informed consent without a legal guardian present.

The process begins with patient registration and consent, followed by EMR creation or updating. The core of the protocol involves detailed wound assessment and documentation, including wound characteristics, etiology, surrounding skin condition, and pain evaluation. Photographic documentation is incorporated with patient consent. The protocol then outlines the documentation of treatment plans, follow-up appointments, patient education, and care coordination efforts.

Key points to note:

1. Patient Consent: Obtain consent for EMR creation, wound care documentation, and photography.

2. Comprehensive Wound Assessment: Document location, size, depth, characteristics, etiology, duration, surrounding skin condition, wound bed appearance, exudate, and pain.

3. Photographic Documentation: Take high-quality digital photographs and link them to the patient's EMR.

4. Treatment Plan: Record current wound care regimen, prescribed medications, and dressing change frequency.

5. Follow-up Planning: Schedule next appointment and document specialist referrals.

6. Patient Education: Document instructions given and materials provided to the patient or caregiver.

7. Care Coordination: Record communication with other healthcare providers and note equipment or supplies ordered for home care.

8. Quality Assurance: Ensure all required fields are completed and documentation meets facility standards and regulatory requirements.

The protocol is considered complete when all required actions have been performed and documented in the patient's EMR, creating a comprehensive wound care record. This standardized approach ensures consistent, high-quality documentation across all wound care patients, facilitating better care coordination and treatment outcomes.
