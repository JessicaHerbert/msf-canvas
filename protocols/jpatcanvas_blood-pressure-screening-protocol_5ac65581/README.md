# Summary of Blood Pressure Screening Protocol for Male Patients Aged 18-39

The protocol aims to ensure effective blood pressure screening for male patients aged 18-39, focusing on those who have not been screened in the past year. It provides guidelines for identifying eligible patients, conducting screenings, and managing follow-up actions.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population of male patients aged 18 to 39. It then narrows down to a subset of those who have not had a documented blood pressure screening in the past year. Exclusion criteria are outlined to ensure that patients with existing hypertension, those on antihypertensive medication, or those with recent screenings are not included. The protocol also excludes patients with secondary causes of hypertension, those hospitalized or in long-term care, and those with terminal illnesses.

The protocol details three main actions: diagnostic, follow-up, and administrative. Diagnostic actions involve scheduling and performing blood pressure screenings using validated equipment and recording results in the patient's electronic health record (EHR). Follow-up actions depend on the blood pressure reading: normal readings lead to annual screenings, elevated readings prompt lifestyle counseling and a 3-6 month follow-up, and hypertension readings require further evaluation and management. Administrative actions focus on documenting all steps and ensuring compliance with guidelines.

Key Points:
- **Target Population:** Male patients aged 18-39 who haven't had a blood pressure screening in the past year.
- **Exclusion Criteria:** Includes patients with diagnosed hypertension, on antihypertensive medication, recent screenings, secondary hypertension causes, hospitalization, long-term care, terminal illness, or palliative care.
- **Diagnostic Actions:** Schedule screenings, use validated sphygmomanometers, and record results in EHR.
- **Follow-up Actions:** 
  - Normal BP: Annual screening.
  - Elevated BP: Lifestyle counseling and 3-6 month follow-up.
  - Hypertension: Further evaluation and management.
- **Administrative Actions:** Document all actions and ensure guideline compliance.
