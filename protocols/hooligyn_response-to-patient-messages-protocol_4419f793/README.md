# Summary of the Protocol for Managing Patient Messages in Canvas Portal

The protocol aims to ensure timely and effective communication between healthcare providers, administrative staff, and patients through the Canvas Patient Portal, ultimately enhancing patient satisfaction and care outcomes.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all healthcare providers and administrative staff with access to the Canvas Patient Portal. It then narrows down to a subset of those assigned to manage patient communications. Exclusion criteria are specified to ensure only qualified and available staff handle patient messages. The protocol outlines a series of actions required to manage patient communications effectively, including administrative, diagnostic, therapeutic, and escalation actions, as well as documentation and quality assurance measures.
