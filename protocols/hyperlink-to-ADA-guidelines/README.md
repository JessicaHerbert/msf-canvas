### Target Population
Designed for patients with a diagnosis of diabetes. It identifies individuals with active diabetes and provides specific recommendations relevant to their care.
### Recommendations
Clinicians provide a hyperlink to the latest ADA (American Diabetes Association) Standard of Care guidelines for diabetes management. The hyperlink directs to the 2025 guidelines and aims to facilitate easy access to up-to-date care standards.
### Importance
Ensuring that clinicians have frictionless access to current guidelines is crucial for maintaining high standards of care. Healthcare providers can quickly access relevant information and ensure that their treatment approaches align with the latest recommendations.
### Conclusion
Integration into a medical record software system to enhance the quality of diabetes care. It identifies patients with diabetes, and for those who qualify, it provides a link to the ADA guidelines. This helps ensure that clinicians can easily access the most current standards of care. For patients without diabetes, the protocol appropriately marks the task as not applicable.
