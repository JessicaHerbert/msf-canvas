# Concussion: Return to Play Protocol

### Target Population
Designed for patients diagnosed with a concussion, focusing on those who are involved in sports or activities where a return-to-play plan is relevant.

### Recommendations
The protocol provides a structured return-to-play plan for athletes recovering from a concussion. 
It includes:
1. No activity
2. Light aerobic exercise
3. Sport-specific exercise
4. Non-contact training drills
5. Full contact practice

### Importance
Managing concussions effectively is crucial to ensure the safety and well-being of patients, especially athletes. Implementing this protocol helps clinicians ensure that patients follow a recommended and systematic approach to safely return to play, minimizing the risk of further injury.

### Conclusion
The protocol automates the monitoring and initiation of return-to-play procedures for concussed patients. It integrates into the clinical workflow by automatically checking patient records for concussion diagnoses and instructions. If the protocol is not yet initiated, it alerts the clinician and provides actionable recommendations, thus enhancing patient care and supporting clinicians in managing concussions more effectively.
