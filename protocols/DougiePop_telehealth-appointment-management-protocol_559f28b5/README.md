# Summary of Clinical Protocol for Telehealth Appointment Management in Canvas EMR

The end goal of this protocol is to ensure the accurate management and scheduling of telehealth appointments within the Canvas Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, enhancing patient satisfaction and operational efficiency.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patient appointments recorded in the Canvas EMR system. It then narrows down to a subset of appointments specifically categorized as 'telehealth'. The protocol outlines exclusion criteria to filter out non-telehealth appointments, canceled or no-show telehealth appointments, and any duplicates or erroneous entries. 

The protocol recommends several actions to achieve its goals:

1. **Diagnostic Actions:** 
   - Verify that appointments are correctly labeled as 'telehealth'.
   - Confirm the integrity and accuracy of appointment data within the Canvas EMR system.

2. **Therapeutic Actions:** 
   - Not applicable in this protocol.

3. **Administrative Actions:** 
   - Gather all telehealth appointments using the Canvas EMR API or interface, ensuring data extraction includes patient ID, appointment date and time, healthcare provider, and appointment status.
   - Input new telehealth appointments into the Canvas EMR, ensuring correct categorization and inclusion of necessary details for scheduling and patient notification.
   - Enter prescription data associated with telehealth appointments securely, verifying accurate recording and linkage to the corresponding appointment and patient record.

4. **Quality Assurance Actions:** 
   - Regularly audit telehealth appointment data for accuracy and completeness.
   - Implement feedback mechanisms for healthcare providers to report discrepancies or issues.

5. **Outcome Measures:** 
   - Aim for increased accuracy and completeness of telehealth appointment records.
   - Improve efficiency in scheduling and managing telehealth appointments.
   - Enhance patient satisfaction through timely and accurate appointment and prescription management.

Important information to note includes:
- The protocol is specifically designed for telehealth appointments within the Canvas EMR system.
- Exclusion criteria are crucial for maintaining data integrity and operational efficiency.
- Administrative actions focus on both data extraction and input, ensuring seamless management of telehealth appointments.
- Quality assurance is an ongoing process, with regular audits and feedback mechanisms in place to address any issues.
- The ultimate goal is to improve the overall experience for both healthcare providers and patients through effective telehealth appointment management.
