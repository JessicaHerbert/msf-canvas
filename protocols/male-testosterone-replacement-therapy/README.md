# Male Hypogonadism Management Protocol
A comprehensive protocol for diagnosing and treating male hypogonadism, focusing on patient assessment, diagnosis, and individualized treatment plans.

## Target Population: Men with Suspected or Confirmed Low Testosterone
This protocol applies to adult men presenting with symptoms of low testosterone, including fatigue, low libido, erectile dysfunction, and mood changes, or those with prior lab-confirmed hypogonadism. It includes individuals with no absolute contraindications for testosterone therapy.

## Comprehensive Assessment and Individualized Treatment
The protocol emphasizes a detailed clinical evaluation (history, physical exam, and lab testing) to confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism. Treatment recommendations include testosterone replacement options such as injections, gels, and pellets, alongside adjunctive therapies when needed. Dosing is individualized, starting conservatively and titrating based on symptom resolution and lab monitoring.

## Importance of Evidence-Based Care and Patient Safety
Proper management of male hypogonadism improves quality of life, addressing both physical and psychological symptoms. Monitoring and follow-up are crucial to ensure therapeutic efficacy, minimize side effects, and address risks such as erythrocytosis or prostate-related concerns. Informed consent and patient education remain central to care.
