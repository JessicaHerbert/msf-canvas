# Summary of Protocol for Monitoring Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The goal of this protocol is to ensure the safe and effective use of GLP-1 receptor agonists by monitoring patients for potential side effects and optimizing therapeutic outcomes.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population of patients currently prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and albiglutide. It then focuses on a subset of these patients who have been on the medication for at least four weeks, as this duration allows for the manifestation of common side effects. The protocol outlines exclusion criteria, including patients who have discontinued the medication, those with documented allergies or adverse reactions, and those participating in clinical trials.

Key actions required by the protocol include:

1. **Systematic Screening:**
   - Conduct comprehensive reviews of medical history and symptoms at each follow-up visit.
   - Use a standardized checklist to screen for common side effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, pancreatitis, thyroid tumors, and hypoglycemia.

2. **Patient Education:**
   - Educate patients on potential side effects and the importance of reporting new or worsening symptoms.
   - Provide written materials and resources for home reference.

3. **Consultation Recommendation:**
   - Recommend consultation with the prescribing healthcare provider if side effects are identified.
   - Advise immediate medical attention for severe or life-threatening side effects and facilitate urgent consultation.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Record all screening findings in the patient's electronic health record (EHR).
   - Document recommendations for consultation and follow-up actions.

5. **Follow-Up:**
   - Schedule regular follow-up appointments to reassess the patient's response and adjust the treatment plan.
   - Coordinate with other healthcare providers to ensure continuity of care.

Important information to note includes:

- The protocol targets patients on GLP-1 medications for at least four weeks, as this is the critical period for side effect manifestation.
- Exclusion criteria are crucial to ensure that only appropriate patients are monitored under this protocol.
- Systematic screening and patient education are emphasized to proactively manage side effects.
- Documentation and follow-up are essential for maintaining comprehensive patient records and ensuring ongoing care.
- The protocol aims to enhance patient safety and optimize therapeutic outcomes through coordinated and thorough monitoring practices.
