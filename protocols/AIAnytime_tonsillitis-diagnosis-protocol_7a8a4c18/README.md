# Summary of the Tonsillitis Diagnosis Protocol

The goal of this protocol is to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective management of tonsillitis in patients, while minimizing unnecessary antibiotic use and addressing potential complications promptly.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of tonsillitis, such as sore throat, difficulty swallowing, fever, swollen tonsils, and white or yellow patches on the tonsils. From this group, a subset is considered for further evaluation, specifically patients aged 3 years and older who present with at least two key symptoms and have had symptoms for less than 10 days.

Patients are excluded from the protocol if they have a history of recurrent tonsillitis, complications requiring immediate surgical intervention, immunocompromised status, known allergies to first-line antibiotics, or recent antibiotic use. The protocol outlines a series of actions to be taken, including diagnostic, therapeutic, administrative, and follow-up actions.

### Important Information:

- **Initial Population**: Patients with symptoms suggestive of tonsillitis.
- **Subset Criteria**: 
  - Age: 3 years and older
  - At least two symptoms: sore throat, fever, swollen tonsils, difficulty swallowing
  - Symptom duration: Less than 10 days

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Recurrent tonsillitis (more than 5 episodes/year)
  - Complications needing surgical intervention
  - Immunocompromised status
  - Allergy to penicillin or first-line antibiotics
  - Recent antibiotic use (within 2 weeks)

- **Diagnostic Actions**:
  - Clinical examination of throat and neck
  - Rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for Group A Streptococcus (GAS)
  - Throat culture if RADT is negative but suspicion remains

- **Therapeutic Actions**:
  - Antibiotic therapy if GAS is confirmed
  - Symptomatic treatment with analgesics and antipyretics

- **Administrative Actions**:
  - Document findings, test results, and treatment plans
  - Educate patients/caregivers on illness, antibiotic course, and complication signs

- **Follow-up Actions**:
  - Schedule follow-up within 48-72 hours
  - Advise return if symptoms worsen or do not improve within 48 hours of antibiotics

This protocol is designed to streamline the diagnosis and treatment process for tonsillitis, ensuring that patients receive appropriate care and education to manage their condition effectively.
