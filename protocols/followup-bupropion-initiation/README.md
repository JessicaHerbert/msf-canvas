# Follow-up Bupropion Initiation

### Target Population
Designed for patients who are newly prescribed bupropion (Wellbutrin or Wellbutrin XL). 
### Recommendations
1. Send Webhook Notification: Immediately notify the patient via their portal about the new prescription, including instructions on monitoring for anxiety and high blood pressure.
2. Create Care Coordinator Task: Generate a task for the care coordinator to follow up with the patient in one week to check medication tolerability and request blood pressure information.
3. Schedule Follow-Up Appointment: Recommend that a follow-up appointment be scheduled for the patient in four weeks to review their response to the medication.
### Importance

- Early Detection: Identifying potential side effects or issues early on.
- Patient Safety: Monitoring for adverse reactions and managing them promptly.
- Medication Adherence: Encouraging patients to continue their medication as prescribed through consistent follow-up.
### Conclusion
- Clinicians can streamline the process of managing new bupropion prescriptions, enhancing patient care through:
- Automated notifications and task creation, which reduces administrative burden.
- Proactive follow-up and monitoring, improving patient outcomes and medication safety.
- Efficient integration with existing workflows, ensuring that care coordinators are alerted to necessary follow-ups and that patients are supported throughout their treatment journey.
