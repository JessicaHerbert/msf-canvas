# Clinical Protocol for Testosterone Therapy in Women
A structured framework for diagnosing and managing testosterone deficiency in women, emphasizing individualized treatment and patient safety.

## Target Population: Women with Symptoms of Testosterone Deficiency
This protocol is designed for adult women experiencing symptoms like low libido, fatigue, mood changes, and reduced muscle mass, with confirmed low testosterone levels. It considers factors such as menopausal status, history of hormone therapy, and contraindications.

## Comprehensive Evaluation and Tailored Treatment
The protocol involves a detailed assessment, including history, physical examination, and lab testing (e.g., testosterone, estradiol, FSH). Treatment options include testosterone pellets, creams, or other non-pellet therapies, with individualized dosing based on age, weight, and menopausal status. Close monitoring ensures optimal symptom resolution and minimizes risks.

## Importance of Evidence-Based Hormone Therapy
Testosterone therapy can significantly improve quality of life for women with hypogonadism, addressing both physical and psychological symptoms. Proper monitoring, informed consent, and patient education are essential to maximize benefits while minimizing potential risks like erythrocytosis, acne, or mood changes.
