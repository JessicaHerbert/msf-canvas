# HCC Capture Extension for Canvas

This Canvas extension facilitates the capture of HCC codes.

- Presents Care Gaps in the patient chart, with recommendations for CDI
  reviewers to validate them. Validation moves them to the Coding Gaps section
  in the patient summary for clinician review.
- Annotates diagnosis search results with an HCC tag based on a provided list.
  These tagged results guide coders to preferred codings.
- Annotates condition list items with an HCC tag based on a provided list,
  both in the patient summary and in the claim view.
