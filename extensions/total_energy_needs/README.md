# Total Daily Energy Expenditure

## Description

Knowing a patient's caloric needs can be especially important for providers in the cardiometabolic health space or for those focusing on weightloss and nutrition. Basal metabolism is usually the largest component of a person's total caloric needs. The daily caloric needs is the basal metabolic rate (BMR) multiplied by a person's activity level factor to determine the total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). 

This extension includes the Activity Factor for Energy Needs Questionnaire and displays a patient's TDEE as a banner in the patient chart. The TDEE is based on the Mifflin-St Jeor equation which factors in a patients sex, age, height, weight, and current activity level. The banner calculation will update whenever a new activity level questionnaire, height, or weight is recorded.
