# PRAPARE Screening Tool

## Description

The Protocol for Responding to & Assessing Patients’ Assets, Risks & Experiences (PRAPARE®) is a national standardized patient risk assessment tool designed to engage patients and to equip healthcare and their community partners to better understand and act on individuals’ social drivers of health (SDOH).

PAPARE core question domains:
- Personal characteristics
- Family and home
- Money and resources
- Social and emotional health

The questionnaire also scores responses. Scores range from 0 to 22, with 0 indicating the participant reported no social determinant of health risks and 22 indicating the participant reported all measured risks.
