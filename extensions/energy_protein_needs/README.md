# Total Daily Energy Expenditure

## Description

Knowing a patient's caloric needs can be especially important for providers in the cardiometabolic health space or for those focusing on weightloss and nutrition. Basal metabolism is usually the largest component of a person's total caloric needs. The daily caloric needs is the basal metabolic rate (BMR) multiplied by a person's activity level factor. 

This extension displays a patient's total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) as a banner in the patient chart. The TDEE is based on the Mifflin-St Jeor equation which factors in a patients sex, age, height, weight, and currently activity level. The banner will update its calculation whenever a new activty level questionnaire, height, or weight is recorded.
