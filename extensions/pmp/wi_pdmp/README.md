# Wisconsin PDMP

## Description

A prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP or PMP) is an electronic database that tracks controlled substance prescriptions. Information from PDMPs can help clinicians identify patients who may be at risk for overdose and provide potentially lifesaving information and interventions. 

This extension will launch the [Wisconsin PDMP](https://pdmp.wi.gov/) in a new window from the Apps menu in the User Action Panel.
